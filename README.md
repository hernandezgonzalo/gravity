# Gravity

Gravity is a platform game developed with pure JavaScript as a project for Ironhack. You can play [here](https://hernandezgonzalo.github.io/gravity/). And you better use Chrome 🤪

## Goal

Our friendly hero has to catch all the stars, going from one platform to another overcoming obstacles by changing gravity.

## Enemies and obstacles

You will find several hazards in your way. Of course, avoiding falling off the platforms will be the main challenge you face. But be careful with the yellow bricks. It is better not to touch them. Finally, although they are not too smart, the enemies will try to prevent you from reaching your goal. Remember that if you change gravity it also affects them.

## Controls

You can control our hero with the **arrow keys**. Also, you can use the **Z key** to change gravity regardless of whether the character is on the floor or on the ceiling. And if you need to turn off the music, just press the **M key**.

Enjoy! 👾
