# Gravity
Gravity is a platform game developed with pure JavaScript as a project for Ironhack.

## Goal
Our friendly hero has to catch all the stars, going from one platform to another avoiding obstacles by changing gravity.

## Enemies and obstacles
You will find several hazards in your way. Of course, avoiding falling off the platform will be the main challenge you face. But be careful with the yellow bricks. It is better not to touch them. Finally, although they are not too smart, the enemies will try to prevent you from reaching your goal. Remember that if you change the gravity it also affects them.

## Controls
You can control our hero with the **arrow keys**. Also, you can use the **Z key** to change gravity regardless of whether it is on the floor or on the ceiling.

Enjoy! ðŸ‘¾
